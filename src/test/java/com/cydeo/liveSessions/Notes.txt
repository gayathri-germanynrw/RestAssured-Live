    -> TestNG
    -> DDT -> Data Driven Testing
        -> @DataProvider
        -> Short Video
    -> SoftAssert sa=new SoftAssert();

           --> Examples

    -> APACHE POI
        -> External Library to Retrieve data from Excel Files

== DB
    -> Junit5
    -> Cucumber-Junit4

== API
    -> Junit5
        -> SoftAssert --> assertAll()
        -> @ParameterizedTest--> DDT
                -> CSVSource
                -> CSVFile

                -> ValueSource
     -> Cucumber-Junit

-- What are the steps for doing API automation ?
    1- Requirement
    2- Read documentation
        -> baseURL + ENDPOINT
        -> Parameters
            -> Path
            -> Query
        -> Header
           REQUEST
            -> Accept      --> API I need data in provided format
            -> ContentType --> API I am sending data in json format
            -> Authorization --> Who we are ?
            -> apiKey --> Who we are ?

           RESPONSE
            -> ContentType -->  Client this the type of data that I am giving
        -> HTTPS METHODS
          -> GET / POST / PUT / PATCH / DELETE
          -> OPTIONS / HEAD

        -> Status Code

     3- Manual Testing
        -> Postman -> Manual Testing
            NOTE --> POSTMAN not for ONLY MANUAL TESTING
            -> We will learn automation with postman as well

     4- Automation Testing
        -> Rest Assured Library
