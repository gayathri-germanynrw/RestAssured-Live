                -> CSVSource
                -> CSVFile
                -> MethodSource
                -> ValueSource
     -> Cucumber-Junit

-- What are the steps for doing API automation ?
    1- Requirement
    2- Read documentation
        -> baseURL + ENDPOINT
        -> Parameters
            -> Path
            -> Query
        -> Header
           REQUEST
            -> Accept      --> API I need data in provided format
            -> ContentType --> API I am sending data in json format
            -> Authorization --> Who we are ?
            -> apiKey --> Who we are ?

           RESPONSE
            -> ContentType -->  Client this the type of data that I am giving
        -> HTTPS METHODS
          -> GET / POST / PUT / PATCH / DELETE
          -> OPTIONS / HEAD

        -> Status Code

     3- Manual Testing
        -> Postman -> Manual Testing
